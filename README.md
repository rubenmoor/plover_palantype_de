Palantype DE
=======================

This is a complete rework of the Possum Palantype steno system for efficient
use with the German language.
Its intended use is with a keyboard, not an actual Palantype machine.
Each finger operates three keys: Home row, top and bottom.
The thumbs are exceptions, they operate four keys.
There is no simultaneous pressing of multiple keys with one finger.

Like the original Palantype, this adaption is compatible with
Qwerty-keyboards as long as they support N-key roll-over (NKRO).
The optimal experience is to be expected with an Ergodox keyboard
or similar, i.e. a keyboard that allows full use of the thumbs.
